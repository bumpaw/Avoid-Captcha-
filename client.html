<p>This <strong>Disclosure Notice</strong> is valid from 09 December 2009</p>

<p>This website is a personal effort of me the site owner. It does try to generate revenue via affiliate links, and these links relate to the content published here. When affiliate marketing works right it brings a shopper and a merchant together, and if a sale occurs then a commission is earned by the affiliate.</p>

<p>Sometimes we express opinions about products, and they are just that. We don't pretend to like things just to get money. Our content is not marked as sponsored or affiliated on an item by item basis, but via this site-wide disclosure notice.</p>

<p>We don't receive money or free stuff for writing reviews. If that changes later on it will be indicated in the review. At this time the only compensation we receive is after an actual sale via our links, and they can be reversed due to customer returns.</p>

<p>We do promote products that we think will be in demand, and from merchants that can take that demand and convert it to a sale.</p>

<p>We at times develop varying degrees of relationship with the merchants, and believe that the merchants we like would be good places for our family to shop. Sometime they turn out to be duds and have severed relations due to negative user feedback. We can't be responsible for what happens after the user leaves our site.</p>

<p>We are not compensated to provide opinions on products, services, websites and various other topics. The views and opinions expressed on this website are purely the website owners. If we claim or appear to be experts on a certain topic or product or service area, we will only endorse products or services that we believe, based on our expertise, are worthy of such endorsement. Any product claim, statistic, quote or other representation about a product or service should be verified with the manufacturer or merchant.</p>

<p>If you ever find confusion in trying to tell whether a website is an affiliate site just look for the shopping cart. 99% of the time only the merchants will have a shopping cart. If you have questions about your order you must contact them.</p>
